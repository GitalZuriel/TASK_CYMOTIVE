    "summary": "Firmware rollback via UDS RequestDownload (0x34) re-introduced patched vulnerabilities. ECU verified firmware signature but not version number.",
    "description": "An ECU firmware rollback attack was executed through the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) protocol on a connected vehicle. The attacker gained access to the diagnostic session through an exposed DoIP (Diagnostics over IP) port on the vehicle's internal network, accessible via the compromised infotainment system. By initiating a UDS RequestDownload (0x34) service with a legitimate but outdated firmware version, the attacker rolled back the Engine Control Module firmware to a version with known vulnerabilities (pre-security-patch). The rollback bypassed the version check because the ECU only verified the firmware signature, not the version number. This re-introduced a previously patched CAN bus authentication bypass vulnerability.",
